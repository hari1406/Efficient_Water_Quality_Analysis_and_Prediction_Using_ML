<p>Dissolved oxygen (DO) :</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a measure of how much oxygen is dissolved in the water - the amount of oxygen available to living aquatic organisms. The amount of dissolved oxygen in a water can tell us a lot about its water quality.Healthy water should generally have dissolved oxygen concentrations above 6.5-8 mg/L and between about 80-120 %.</p>
<p>potential hydrogen (ph):</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   pH is a measure of how acidic/basic water is. The range goes from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. pHs of less than 7 indicate acidity, whereas a pH of greater than 7 indicates a base. pH is really a measure of the relative amount of free hydrogen and hydroxyl ions in the water.</p>
<p>Conductivity:</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   Conductivity is a measure of the ability of water to pass an electrical current. Because dissolved salts and other inorganic chemicals conduct electrical current, conductivity increases as salinity increases.</p>
<p>Biochemical Oxygen Demand:</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   BOD is a measure of the amount of oxygen required to remove waste organic matter from water in the process of decomposition by aerobic bacteria (those bacteria that live only in an environment containing oxygen).</p>
<p>Nitrate-N :</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   Nitrate-N is found naturally in soil and water, but usually at relatively low concentrations (less than 4 mg/L in water). However, nitrate is highly soluble and is easily transported when contamination sources come into contact with water.</p>
<p>Total coliform :</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   Total coliform counts give a general indication of the sanitary condition of a water supply. Total coliforms include bacteria that are found in the soil, in water that has been influenced by surface water, and in human or animal waste.</p>
